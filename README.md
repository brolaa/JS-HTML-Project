# JS-HTML-Project
Simple internet application I created back in 2022. Made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Start Bootstrap - Blog Home v5.0.8 (https://startbootstrap.com/template/blog-home) was used as the base site template. It also uses Bootstrap, jQuery, lightbox.js gallery and leaflet.js maps.

### Project Description
Simple travel blog with posts. It features a home page that generates random posts, a gallery with all the photos, a map that can track the user's location and a simple CRUD trip manager. OpenWeatherMap API was used to display current weather. The layout is fully responsive. Application and code comments are in Polish.

### Instalation
1. Add OpenWeatherMap API key in _pogoda.js_ file and leaflet API key in _mapa.js_ file
2. Change addresses in _galeria.js_ and _scripts.js_ files
3. Put project folder on HTML server (I used XAMPP).
